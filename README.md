# Journey_Lua_Modder
A python GUI application aiming to make Lua injection to the game "Journey" easier. 

### How to install:

Download JourneyLuaModder.py, TickHook.lua, and StartLua.lua to Journey root folder.

_Carefully_ embed Tick.lua.gz into Journey.exe according to [this tutorial made by Alazar88 (click here)](https://thatgamecompanyfan.boards.net/thread/541/pc-lua-script-editing-injection)

(You need to get approved in the modding forum to view the thread)

If the above doesn't work modify \_\_Tick.lua.gz with our changes and embed that.

__Optional recommendations:__
- Patch your modding exe via steamless to disable Steam launching redirection, still requires Steam running.
- Use a emulator when modding to avoid impacting others gameplay.

Requires Python 3.6+

This tool is a work in progress. Additional functionality will be added from time to time.
